# Doing statistical hypothesis tests
* Key method
  + Linear mixed-models(lmms)
    + Data is repeated measured(along to the time) and there are some missing values
    + To compare the effects of the two stations in Antarctic on sleep/feelings responses
  + Posterior analysis: two-sample/paired t-test with bonferroni correction
    + To test the differences of responses related to sleep/feelings between the two stations in Antarctic
    + Doing two-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction for the two-stations when the effect of stations is significant in lmm
    + Doing paired t-test with Bonferroni correction for the measured time-points when the effect of time is significant in lmm 
* Unfortunately, Due to business security, data and the summary of the analysis result cannot be provided
* Only R code is provided
* [Done] 2021. 07
* The example of EDA before doing lmms
